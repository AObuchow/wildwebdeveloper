## üí° Design and Architecture

Wild Web Developer is based on the Eclipse Generic Editor framework from [Eclipse Platform](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform), [Eclipse LSP4E](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lsp4e) and [Eclipse TM4E](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e) in order to provide editors based on TextMate grammars, Visual Studio Code HTML CSS & JSON Language Servers, Theia's [TypeScript and JavaScript language servers](https://github.com/theia-ide/typescript-language-server), Red Hat's [xml-languageserver](https://github.com/angelozerr/lsp4xml) and [yaml-language-server](https://github.com/redhat-developer/yaml-language-server/) from Red Hat; and on Eclipse Debug stack, LSP4E Debug Adapter Protocol support and Visual Studio Code Node Debug Adapter to provide debugging.
